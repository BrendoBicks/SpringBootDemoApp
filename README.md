# ðŸ§© Asset Management API

A Spring Boot REST API that performs basic CRUD operations on assets and related tables. The API demonstrates proper use of DTOs, service layers, validation, and database migrations using Flyway.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Basic CRUD operations on:
  - `assets`
  - `asset_types`
  - `asset_status`
- Relationships:
  - Each Asset is associated with a single AssetType and AssetStatus
- **DTOs** used to return only selected Asset fields (for demonstration)
- Returns **400 Bad Request** when required fields are missing
- Returns **404 Not Found** when entities cannot be located
- Some business logic is abstracted into AssetService for a cleaner AssetController
- **Flyway** is used to manage and version the database schema
